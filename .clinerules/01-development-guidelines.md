# Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

### Description

This project is a **web application** designed to manage resources through basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **UI Libraries**: Ant Design (Antd), Admiral
- **Routing**: React Router

## Development Principles

### Core Requirements

- Ensure all generated code is **error-free** and requires no manual correction
- Target audience: non-technical users
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Methodical Approach

- Avoid generating complete files in one step
- Proceed step-by-step with careful validation
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces

#### 2. Context Analysis

- **Always summarize** user requests before implementation
- Study existing code patterns and examples first
- Understand project structure thoroughly

#### 3. Quality Assurance

- State confidence level (0-10) before and after tool usage
- **Never omit or truncate code**
- Complete implementation checklist:
  1. Analyze all relevant code files
  2. Understand full context and dependencies
  3. Implement with completeness and clarity
  4. Verify integration with existing codebase

## Special Cases
